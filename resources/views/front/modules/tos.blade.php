                <p><strong>Third-Party Links</strong></p>
                <p>In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, PETiD may link to sites operated by
                    third parties. However, even if the third party is affiliated with PETiD, PETiD has no
                    control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices,
                    independent of PETiD. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you
                    access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, PETiD seeks to protect the integrity of its
                    website and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site,
                    but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work). </p>
